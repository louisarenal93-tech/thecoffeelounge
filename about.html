  <h1>Welcome to The Coffee Lounge</h1>
  <p>
    The Coffee Lounge began as a family dream on April 16, 2023, and officially opened its doors on July 8, 2023.
    Inspired by my motherâ€™s daily love for coffee something I came to cherish this passion eventually blossomed into a shared vision with my husband, who is equally enthusiastic about all things coffee.
  </p>
  <p>
    Together, we transformed that passion into a business venture: a warm and welcoming space where people can enjoy high-quality coffee in a cozy, comfortable setting.
  </p>
   <p>Every dish on the menu carries a personal touch all the sauces and recipes are crafted by the owner. 
  From the flavors you taste to the secret blends we use, everything is made with passion and care, straight from our kitchen to your table.
  </p>
  <p>
    Located in the heart of Jose Panganiban, Barangay South Poblacion, Camarines Norte, The Coffee Lounge has become a growing community hub.
    We serve an average of 15 customers daily, with numbers rising to around 30 during peak seasons.
    The shop is proudly operated by two regular staff members and one part-time crew member, all dedicated to providing excellent service and a friendly, relaxing experience.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Coffee Lounge is owned by Mr. Rowell and Mrs. Santee Ebue.
